## Instructions

Welcome to the MyReads App project! The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the value of React for app development. For this project, the application was created with `create-react-app` and `npm start` to get it installed and launched.

## Purpose

MyReads App is a student requirement for completion of the Grow With Google Udacity Front-End Nanodegree (FEND) program. The purpose of the MyReads App project is to illustrate the fundamentals of using React in development.

A static example of the CSS and HTML markup was provided in starter code form Udacity. The React code had to be added to provide interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code. Good React design practice involves creating new JS files for each component and using import/require statements to include the components where they are needed.

## Requirements

To launch the application, install all project dependencies with `npm install`. Start the development server with `npm start`. In addition, a web browser is required. A text editor is needed to view the details of the code.

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.

## Contributing

This repository contains a combination of project starter code from Udacity and code written by Minette J. Roberson. Because this MyReads App Project is the product of a GWG Udacity FEND Project,  pull requests will most likely not be accepted until further notice.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

Udacity provided a backend server for development. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods needed to perform necessary operations on the backend, including [`getAll`](#getall), [`update`](#update), and [`search`](#search) .
